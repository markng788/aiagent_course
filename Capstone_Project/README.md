# Capstone Project

This folder is for the course capstone project: design notes, datasets, notebooks, and code.

Suggested structure:

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks and Kaggle workbooks
- `src/` — source code and helper modules
- `data/` — datasets (or links to external data)
- `docs/` — design documents and evaluation notes

Place project files here as you develop the capstone.
