# What Is the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive?

This immersive 5-day program explores the foundations and practical applications of AI agents, covering:

Models
Tools
Orchestration
Memory
Evaluation

The course emphasizes how agents transcend simple LLM prototypes and evolve into production-ready, real-world systems.aiagent_course
This repo contains my work in the 5-day intensive course on AI agents, hosted by Google via Kaggle.
📆 Daily Modules & Assignments

🟦 Day 1 — Introduction to Agents
Whitepaper Highlights
Taxonomy of agent capabilities
Importance of Agent Ops for reliability and governance
Interoperability and security through identity and constrained policies
Codelabs
Build your first AI agent using Gemini + ADK

Use Google Search as an external tool

🟩 Day 2 — Agent Tools & MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Whitepaper Highlights
External tool functions for real-time actions
Best practices for designing agent tools
Introduction to MCP: communication, risks, readiness
Codelabs
