## Overview

This 5-day program explores how agents go beyond simple LLM prototypes and become robust, reliable systems suitable for production. Key focus areas include:

- Models — capabilities and selection
- Tools — safe external actions and tool design
- Orchestration — multi-agent communication and workflows
- Memory — short-term sessions and long-term persistence
- Evaluation — observability, metrics, and human-in-the-loop (HITL)

## Daily Modules & Assignments

### Day 1 — Introduction to Agents

- Whitepaper highlights
- Taxonomy of agent capabilities
- Agent Ops: reliability and governance
- Identity, policies, and secure interoperability

Codelabs / Exercises:

- Build your first AI agent using Gemini + ADK
- Build a multi-agent system
- Use Google Search as an external tool

### Day 2 — Agent Tools & MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- Whitepaper highlights
- External tool functions for real-time actions
- Best practices for tool design and safety
- MCP introduction: communication patterns, risk model, readiness signals

Codelabs / Exercises:

- Turn Python functions into agent-executable tools
- Use MCP for interoperability
- Implement long-running operations with human approval

### Day 3 — Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory

- Whitepaper highlights
- Context engineering for stateful, personalized agents
- Sessions: short-term conversational state
- Memory: persistent, long-term storage and retrieval

Codelabs / Exercises:

- Build stateful agents using conversation history
- Use working memory inside a session
- Implement long-term memory across sessions

### Day 4 — Agent Quality

- Whitepaper highlights
- Holistic evaluation framework for agents
- Observability foundations: logs, traces, metrics
- Techniques: LLM-as-Judge, human-in-the-loop (HITL)

### Day 5 — Prototype to Production

- Whitepaper highlights
- Deployment, scaling, and productionization patterns
- A2A Protocol for multi-agent communication
- Transitioning from prototype to enterprise-grade systems

Codelabs / Exercises:

- Build multi-agent systems using A2A
- (Optional) Deploy agents to Vertex AI Agent Engine
