    "**1. Verify Your Account (Required)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Kaggle Notebooks in this course, you'll need to verify your account with a phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this in your [Kaggle settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Make Your Own Copy**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run any code in this notebook, you first need your own editable copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a private copy of the notebook just for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Run Code Cells**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your copy, you can run code.\n",

    "\n",
    "For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 **NOTE:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 **NOTE:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)"
